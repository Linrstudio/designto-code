## What does it mean?

### By "design". What does it mean?

The term `design` here stands for the UI/UX design source file made by human designers. There are various tools currently available such like Figma, Sketch, XD, and Upcomming [Bridged Studio](https://github.com/bridgedxyz/bridged)

Taking more deeper look, the design data tree is represented with Reflect -- A design standard that bridged developed / adopted. (Yes, this is that Reflect that also provided as a UI Library)

TL;DR -- You can convert your design to code from Figma, Sketch, and XD.
