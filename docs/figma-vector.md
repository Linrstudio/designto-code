# Figma Vectors

## Resizing

### Web - css

**Using viewBox**

## Towards clean design / code

**Do not use rectangle shape as a vector. (as background)**

We often see designers using vector path as a rect shape, placing it as a background. This approach is only recommanded when clipping graphics. Having a solid / gradient color rect in a vector node is not recommanded.

- Don't set constraint to stretch for vector
  Accepted values are `left` | `right` | `top` | `bottom` | `scale` (with aspect ratio)
